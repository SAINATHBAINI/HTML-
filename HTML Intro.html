*HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language.
*HTML is a Languages of web. It is used to create websites.
*We use HTML tags to define and feel of a website.
*HTML is used for defining layout of a page -A barebone page structure.
*We can perform the HTML in 2 ways 
  1.Notepad
  2.Text Editors(Ex:VSCode)
*Let us consider a example to understand the diff b/w the HTML,CSS,JS.
  Ex: Car Manufacturing
  HTML : Car Body (which consists only metal part).
  CSS  : Car painting ,Decoration etc (which means adding design).
  JS   : Car Engine (Interior part)
 {This all comes together, to build a Strong Website}

*NOTE:
1.HTML is a case insensitivity language, H1 & h1 tags are the same.
        {but it is highly recommonded to use the lower case letter}
2.Comment line HTML <!--HTML COMMENT-->    
3.HTML Extension { .html or .htm }    
4.HTML consists 
     *Client 
     *Server
     *Browser
5.If we want to change any text or anything in the in any website ,we just need to "inspect" that and rewite it.
     {But it is only visible to you and fro temperory}      
6.HTML = Start tag + content + end tag.

*A basic HTML page structure
<!DOCTYPE html> {specifies that it is an HTML document}
<html> {root of an html page} 
<head> {contains page metadata}
     <title>Sai's Website </title> {contains title}
</head>
<br> {it is a break tag and it is not having the closing tag }
<body> {it contains the main body of the page}
    <h1>This is heading tag </h1>  {heading tag}        
    <p>this comsists of paragraphs</p>  {paragraph tag}          
</body>
</html>

*head and body tags are the children of html tags.
*html is having opening and closing tags with content in between them.
*some of the html tags are not having content, those type of tags are called as "Empty tags" eg: <br>

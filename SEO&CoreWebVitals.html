*Core Web Vitals Overview: Core Web Vitals are essential for ensuring a good user experience on websites. They focus on the loading performance, interactivity, and visual stability of a page. This is crucial for maintaining user engagement and satisfaction .

*Key Metrics of Core Web Vitals.
1.Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):
   - Measures visual stability by quantifying how much the layout shifts during page load.
   - A low CLS score is essential to prevent unexpected shifts that can lead to poor user experiences. For example, if an image loads and pushes content down, it can cause users to click on the wrong element .

2.Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):
   - Measures loading performance by tracking how long it takes for the largest visible element (like an image or video) to load.
   - A good LCP score is under 2.5 seconds, indicating that the main content is loading quickly .

3. First Input Delay (FID):
   - Measures interactivity by tracking the time it takes for a page to respond to the first user interaction (like clicking a button).
   - Ideally, FID should be less than 100 milliseconds to ensure a responsive experience .

*Improving Core Web Vitals
Using Lighthouse Reports:
- Lighthouse is a tool that generates reports on various performance metrics, including Core Web Vitals. It provides suggestions for improvements, such as optimizing image sizes and ensuring proper width and height attributes are set for images .
- Best Practices:
- Ensure images have defined width and height to prevent layout shifts.
- Optimize images and other resources to improve loading times.
- Regularly check Lighthouse reports to identify areas for improvement .

*SEO Considerations:
*Meta Tags and Descriptions:
- Proper use of meta tags, including titles and descriptions, is crucial for SEO. The title should reflect the page content accurately, enhancing visibility in search results .
- Avoid using outdated practices like meta keywords, as they no longer significantly impact SEO rankings .

*Responsive Design:
- Ensure that the website is responsive across different devices. Tools like Chrome's DevTools can help visualize how a site appears on various screen sizes, means how it looks in the mobiles,desktops,etc..
